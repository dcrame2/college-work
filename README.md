This is a collection of Dylan Cramers projects using HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, and PHP using restful services


For Project Label GreekLifeWebsite:

This project was created with a fellow classmate. During this project we were told to make a website of our choosing from scratch and make it out own with creative and fun content. We used HTML/CSS to create a Greek Life Wesbite at Illinois State University. We utilize BootStrap and this creates a responsive web page for all devices we utilize: jumbotron, carausal, etc. within BootStrap.


For Project Labled ZombieMiniGame:

This was more a fun project that was given to me. Its just a simple mini game to eat zombie brains, you control the zombie using your arrow keys and just move it to the brains. Its a real simple application but there is a lot of front-end and backend development to make the game usable using HTML/CSS.



For Project Labeled Assingment6:

This was a project I had created in PHP using MVC framework CodeIgnitor. I comsume an API and use RESTful Services to fload a MySQL
database of album names. We use a REST service called RESTlet to send the data in the different forms of jSON and XML to the database.
Here I am using two methods POST and DELETE, one post the data to the database and one to delete the data from the database. I had use a
localhost server (MAMP server) to view the data locally and then had to push the code to our professors github account. 

The files that have my work that I created and changed are in the controllers, views and models files.

For Project labeled HTML/CSS:

This is a project that is made with HTML and CSS to create a repsonsive website using MediaQueries. Starting from mobile version to desktop. I create a simple grid layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop view. 

For Project Labeled DMC-Program03 and DMC-Program04

I created these project from scratch in Eclipse using Java and display in the console. They both utilize key function of Java.
